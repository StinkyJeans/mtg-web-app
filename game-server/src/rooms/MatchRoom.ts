 *   (vote    → no longer used: every deck is 60 cards, the host's "Vote" button now goes straight to decks)
 *   decks    → both players choose a deck of that size
 *   coin     → the guest calls heads or tails, the server flips the coin; whoever wins it chooses who goes first
 *   playing  → the game runs HERE: the server holds the real game state and the rules; the browsers only send actions

 *
 * Nothing secret is ever sent: each player gets a view of the game with the opponent's hand and both libraries face down.
 *
 * The match is saved after every change. When the server restarts (a deploy) it is saved once more and the players are let
 * go; their browsers then ask for it back with `restore`, which brings it back under the same room id.
